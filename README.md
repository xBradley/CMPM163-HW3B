Part B - Begin Planning Your Final Project 

	I want to possibly implemenet Crepuscular rays, also commonly known as sunsbeams, sun rays, splintered lights, or as I know it from video games, god rays. Basically crepuscular rays are beams of light that shine from a single point, the sun, through openings in clouds or other obstructing objects. Other than aesthetic purposes, the rays are good at telling the player what direction the sun is. The light beams also light up clouds so that they look like they have more volumetric shape. Crepuscular rays are just parallel lines from the sun source, with pretty effects. 
	
	Luckly enough, unity has documentation on creating crepuscular rays. They use the term Sun Shafts. But if I were to make it myself, I would think it would be similar to making a camera script that calculates parallel lines from the sun source. Then when a light vector hits an object, look for a hole in that object and shine light through it and/or shine light around the outline of the object.
	
	Currently, I am in a group with Alan Vasilkovsky. We are looking for another group member. But right now we plan on mkaing a endless platforming runner game. The game would have audio beats that the level would follow and switch between different shaders sa the game progresses.
